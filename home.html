&emsp;Welcome to my site which purpose is to document some useful solutions encountered during faceing with various IT tasks.
I'm going to focus on programming mainly around C++, virtualization, Windows and Linux OS and everything else that I come across.
Some of the articles may not bring up new subjects for the reader but hopefully present them in more understable and shortened form with most important issues compressed in one place only.<br/><br/>
&emsp;I think we created machines to solve our existing problems faster as we are limited by the time in our world and amount of data we need to process grew up hugely, but didn't that create new bunch of problems we have to face with now?
Similar as we create multithreaded processors or even join them into clusters, connecting the minds is important in the same way to exchange and process data in a satisfactory time or what is even most important to process them at all. Communication is the key.
