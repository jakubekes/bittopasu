<div>
&emsp;Here is the simple example how to use <a class="external_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.openwall.com/john/" >John the Ripper</a> password cracker in case of password protected MS Office document like docx.<br/>
First we need to create hash of the file and this can be made with one of John's scripts written in <a class="external_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" >Python</a> under <span class="quote">\run\office2john.py</span>. When you have Python installed just type in cmd:<br/>

<div class ="code_short">python <span class ="quote">&lt;path to office2john.py&gt; &lt;path to Office file&gt;</span> &gt; <span class ="quote">&lt;path to file where hash has to be saved&gt</span>
</div>
When we have the hash file we can start hacking. John has a lot of options which can be checked in <a class="external_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.openwall.com/john/doc/" >documentation</a> or invoked with --help. For my case I got some advices what the password could be, so I could create some pattern/mask to significantly shorten the hacking time. It looked like this:<br/>

<div class ="code_image">
<img class = "content_image" style='display:block; margin: 0px auto; box-shadow: inset 0 3px 6px rgba(255,255,255,.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(255,255,255,.45); border-radius: 6px;' src='pictures/john1.png'>
</div>

Also normally John will use CPU, but it's much faster to take advantage of GPU if we have such possibility. John itself recommends tu add <span class="code_quote">--format=office-opencl</span> parameter, however we can expect this outcome:<br/>

<img class = "content_image" style='display:block; margin: 20px auto; box-shadow: inset 0 3px 6px rgba(255,255,255,.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(255,255,255,.45); border-radius: 6px;' src='pictures/john2.png'>

To fix this we need to edit the file <span class ="quote">\etc\OpenCL\vendors\amd.icd</span> with the default path pointing to c:\Windows\System32\amdocl64.dll (there is also naturally nvidia.icd file with the default path c:\Windows\System32\nvopencl.dll) and we need to edit it by finding first proper path for this file, anyway look for it under c:\Windows\System32. After fix we can go further:

<img class = "content_image" style='display:block; margin: 20px auto; box-shadow: inset 0 3px 6px rgba(255,255,255,.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(255,255,255,.45); border-radius: 6px;' src='pictures/john3.png'>

<div class ="code_short">john.exe --mask=[a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z]?d?d --format=office-opencl C:\Users\Bill\Desktop\john\hash.txt
</div>

..and succesfully crack the password:<br/>

<img class = "content_image" style='display:block; margin: 20px auto; box-shadow: inset 0 3px 6px rgba(255,255,255,.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(255,255,255,.45); border-radius: 6px;' src='pictures/john4.png'>

Just please notice I changed the mask to make it faster :). Correct password is passw12. Also worth attention is that we can press 'q' or Ctrl-C to quit and use any other key to show the cracking status.
If you want to play with different options for the same hash, compare CPU vs GPU cracking speed etc. you need to delete the corresponding log from the file <span class="quote">\run\john.pot</span> as john will inform you it has been already hacked.
